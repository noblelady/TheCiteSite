# The Cite Site

Created during WicHacks 2017

The Cite Site is a research tool meant to make writing papers easier.

You enter a URL of an article and it scrapes the page and returns all the text.

You can then select text and add it to tags of your choosing, either new tags or some of our pre-established ones.

You can also add citations for each article in MLA format.

After exiting the modal all the tags will appear on the main page for easy access.
